For two [[Rings]] $R$ and $S$, a mapping $f: R \to S$ is called a ring homomorphism if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. For any $(a, b) \in R$, $f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)$.
2. For any $(a, b) \in R$, $f(ab) = f(a) \cdot f(b)$.
3. $f(1_R) = 1_S$.

Here, the operations on the left-hand side of each condition are those defined in $R$, and the operations on the right-hand side are those defined in $S$. If such a mapping $f$ is bijective, it is called a [[Ring Isomorphism]].

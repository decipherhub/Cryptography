A [[Binary Relation]] $\sim$ on a set $X$ is called an equivalence relation on $X$ if it satisfies the following properties for all $a, b, c \in X$:

1.  Reflexive
2.  Symmetric
3.  Transitive

## Equivalence Class

The set of elements in $X$ that are equivalent to a specific element under the relation $\sim$ is called the equivalence class. For example, the equivalence class of an element $a$ is denoted as follows.
$$[a] = \{x\in X: x \sim a\}$$

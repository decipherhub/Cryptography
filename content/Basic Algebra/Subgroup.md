# Definition

Given a [[Group]] $(G, ∗)$ and a subset $H$ of $G$, if $H$ forms a group under the operation $∗|_{H×H}$, then $H$ is called a Subgroup of $G$. We denote that $H$ is a Subgroup of $G$ by writing $H \le G$.

# Examples

1.  For a given $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, $(n) := {nx \mid x \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is a Subgroup of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$.
2.  $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R}) := {A \in Mat_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R}) \mid \det(A) = 1}$ is a Subgroup of $(GL_{2}(\mathbb{R}), \times)$.

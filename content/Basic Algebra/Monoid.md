# Definition of a Monoid

Given a [Binary Operation] $*$ : $S \times S \rightarrow S$ on a set $S$, the pair $(S, *)$ is called a monoid if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. $*$ is associative.
2. There exists an identity element $e \in S$.

# Examples
1. $(\mathbb{Z}, \times)$ is a Monoid. However, it is not a [[Group]].
2. $(Mat_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R}), \times)$ is a Monoid. However, it is not a [[Group]].

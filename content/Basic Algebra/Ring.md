# Definition
A Ring is an algebraic structure consisting of a set equipped with two operations: addition and multiplication. If the set $R$ has well-defined addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\cdot$) operations that satisfy the following properties, then $(R, +, \cdot)$ is called a **ring**.

1. $(R, +)$ forms a [[Commutative Group]]:
    - Associativity: $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$
    - Commutativity: $a + b = b + a$
    - Existence of an identity element: $a + 0_R = a$
    - Existence of inverse elements: For each $a \in R$, there exists $x \in R$ such that $a + x = 0_R$

2. $(R, \cdot)$ forms a [[Monoid]]:
    - Associativity: $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$
    - Existence of an identity element: $a \cdot 1_R = a$

3. Distributive laws hold:
    - $(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$
    - $c \cdot (a + b) = c \cdot a + c \cdot b$

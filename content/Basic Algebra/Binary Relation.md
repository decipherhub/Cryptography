# Definition
A binary relation on a given set $A$ is a set of ordered pairs that is a subset of $A \times A$. For an ordered pair $(x, y) \in R$ in a binary relation $R$, there is a specific relationship between $x$ and $y$. This is denoted as $xRy$, $R(x, y)$, $x \sim_R y$, or $x \sim y$.

# Example
Typical examples of binary relations include reflexive, symmetric, and transitive relations.
1.  Reflexive: $a \sim a$
2.  Symmetric: $a \sim b$ if and only if $b \sim a$
3.  Transitive: $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$ imply $a \sim c$
4.  Anti-symmetric: $a \sim b$ and $b \sim a$ imply $a = b$

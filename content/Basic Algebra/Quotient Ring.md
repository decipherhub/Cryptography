# Definition
Given a [[Ring]] $(R, +, \cdot)$ and an [[Ideal]] $I$, we can define operations on $R/I$ that make it a ring, called the quotient ring.

>**Definition** $R/I$
>- **Addition**: The addition of two equivalence classes* $[a]$ and $[b]$ in $R/I$ is defined as $[a] + [b] = [a+b]$.
>- **Multiplication**: The multiplication of two equivalence classes* $[a]$ and $[b]$ in $R/I$ is defined as $[a] \cdot [b] = [a \cdot b]$.
>*For more on equivalence classes, see [[Equivalence Relation]].

The quotient ring simplifies complex algebraic structures into a more manageable form and is useful in deriving important concepts such as [[Ring Isomorphism]].

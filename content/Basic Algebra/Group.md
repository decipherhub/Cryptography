# Group

Given a [[Binary Operation]] $*$ : $G \times G \rightarrow G$ on a set $G$, the pair $(G, *)$ is defined as a group if it satisfies the following conditions:

1.  $*$ is associative.
2.  There exists an identity element $e \in G$.
3.  For each element $a \in G$, there exists an inverse element $a^{-1} \in G$.

# Example

- $GL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ is the set of all invertible 2Ã—2 matrices, and with matrix multiplication, it forms a group.

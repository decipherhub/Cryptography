A general logarithm is the inverse function of an exponential function, representing the power to which a fixed base must be raised to obtain a given number. That is, it refers to the value $x$ that satisfies $a^x = b$.

A discrete logarithm has the same form as a general logarithm but is defined in the discrete algebraic structure of group theory. The simplest form of a discrete logarithm is defined in $Z_p^*$. Let's consider the set $Z_p^* = {1, ..., p-1}$, which is closed under multiplication modulo a prime number $p$. Given an element $g$ and $y$ in $Z^*_p$, the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) is to find $x$ such that $g^x \equiv y \mod p$, i.e., to compute $\log_g y$.

When the prime $p$ is sufficiently large, it is easy to compute $y$ from $g$ and $x$, but it is difficult to find $x$ from $g$ and $y$. Cryptographic systems such as [[ElGamal]] and [[Diffie-Hellman]] exploit this property.

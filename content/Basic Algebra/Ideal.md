# Definition

Given a [[Ring]] $(R, +, \cdot)$, a **subset** $I$ of $R$ is called an **ideal** if it satisfies the following conditions:

1.  $(I, +)$ is a [[Subgroup]] of $(R, +)$.
2.  For all $r \in R$ and $x \in I$, $rx \in I$ and $xr \in I$.
    -   If only $rx \in I$ holds, $I$ is called a **left ideal**. If only $xr \in I$ holds, $I$ is called a **right ideal**. If both conditions hold, $I$ is called a **two-sided ideal** or simply an ideal.

# Characteristics

Ideals have the following characteristics:

-   The [[Opposite Ring]] of a left ideal is a right ideal, and the same relationship holds for right ideals.
-   An ideal is a sub-[[Pseudoring]] of the ring $(R, +, \cdot)$.

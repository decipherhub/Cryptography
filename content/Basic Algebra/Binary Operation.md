# Definition
A binary operation on a set $S$ means mapping the elements of $S \times S$ to $S$. In other words, it refers to a function $f$ : $S \times S \rightarrow S$. Given a binary operation $*$ : $S \times S \rightarrow S$, $_(a, b)$ is denoted as $a * b$.

# Example  
Let $Mat_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of 2 Ã— 2 real matrices. Then, the matrix multiplication $(A, B) \mapsto AB$ is a binary operation.

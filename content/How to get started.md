Welcome to Cryptography SecondBrain! This comprehensive wiki is designed to help you learn various cryptographic topics, from basic algebra to advanced Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET). Begin by examining the ==dependency graph== to see how different cryptographic concepts are connected.

#### Example - Schnorr Signature
For example, if a learner wants to study Schnorr Signatures, they can follow these steps:
1. Start by reading the [[Schnorr Signature]] document briefly.
2. Study the algebraic knowledge underlying Schnorr Signatures by referring to the [[Cyclic Subgroup]] and [[Group]] in the dependency graph.
    - Click on the nodes in the graph to navigate directly to the relevant documents.
3. Go back and study the design of Schnorr Signatures in detail.
4. To understand the use cases of Schnorr Signatures, study [[Digital Signature]].
    - For deeper learning, explore public key cryptography, hashing, and other digital signature algorithms in the dependency graph.
5. To assess the security level of Schnorr Signatures, study the [[Discrete logarithm problem]] in the dependency graph.

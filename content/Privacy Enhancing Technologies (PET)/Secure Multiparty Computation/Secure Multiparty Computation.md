# Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC)

## Definition
Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) is a cryptographic protocol that allows multiple parties to perform joint computations using their individual inputs while keeping these inputs completely private. In MPC, each participant's data remains confidential, and no party can access the data of another. This protocol ensures the accuracy of the computation results by revealing only the final outcome without disclosing any intermediate steps.

## Use Cases
One of the primary applications of MPC is the secure aggregation of data from different data owners. For example, when multiple organizations need to perform joint data analysis or derive insights from various datasets, MPC can be used to ensure that each party's data remains private throughout the process. This is particularly useful in scenarios where data privacy is crucial, such as healthcare, finance, and collaborative research. By using MPC, organizations can collaborate and derive valuable insights without compromising data privacy and security.

## Advantages
1. **Privacy Assurance:** MPC ensures that sensitive data remains private, with computations carried out without exposing individual inputs.
2. **Data Security:** As data is not exposed in plaintext, it helps prevent data breaches and leaks.
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** MPC aids in complying with data protection regulations, ensuring that sensitive data is not shared or exposed.
4. **Collaborative Analysis:** Multiple entities can collaborate on data analysis projects without compromising their proprietary data.

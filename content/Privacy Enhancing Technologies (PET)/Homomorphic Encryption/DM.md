## DM (Dijk-Meyer) Scheme

The DM scheme, proposed by Dijk and Meyer, is a homomorphic encryption scheme based on the [[Learning with Errors (LWE)]] problem.

### Key Components

1. **Secret Key Generation**: The secret key is selected from a set of integers.
2. **Public Key Generation**: The public key is composed of the secret key and LWE samples.
3. **Encryption**: Messages are encrypted by treating them as integers.
4. **Decryption**: Ciphertexts are decrypted to restore the original message.

### Homomorphic Operations

The DM scheme supports basic homomorphic operations.

- **Homomorphic Addition**: Performed through integer addition.
- **Homomorphic Multiplication**: Performed through integer multiplication.

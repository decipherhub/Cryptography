ECDSA is a key exchange method that utilizes the [Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)] and is the most widely used digital signature algorithm in blockchain technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as in digital certificates.

The diagram below illustrates the three main algorithms of ECDSA. The private key, digital signature components  r  and  s , and the message hash are all scalar values, and these values are subjected to multiple multiplication operations with  G  (the base point) or the public key.

# Shor's Algorithm

## Definition

**Shor's Algorithm** is a *quantum* algorithm discovered by Peter Shor in 1994, designed to factor large integers and solve discrete logarithms in **polynomial time** on a quantum computer. This capability poses a significant threat to **classical cryptography** schemes, such as [[RSA]] and [[Diffie-Hellman]], which rely on the infeasibility of factoring large numbers or computing discrete logarithms with classical computers.

Shor’s Algorithm exploits the power of **quantum parallelism** and the **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** to find the period of a function related to the integer in question. By determining this period, it becomes possible to derive non-trivial factors of large numbers—or solve discrete logs—exponentially faster compared to any known classical algorithm.

## Use Cases

Despite often being described in the context of *breaking* cryptography, Shor's Algorithm has broader implications:

- **Cryptanalysis**: It is primarily famous for breaking [[RSA]], [[Elliptic Curves]] **Cryptography (ECC)**, and other discrete-log-based systems if (and when) large-scale quantum computers become practical.
- [[Post-Quantum Cryptography]] **(PQC) Research**: Shor’s Algorithm directly motivates the field of **post-quantum** or **quantum-resistant** cryptography, prompting the design of new cryptographic schemes believed to be secure against quantum attacks.
- **Scientific and Academic**: In quantum computing courses and research, Shor’s Algorithm is often used as a central illustration of how quantum algorithms can vastly outperform classical algorithms for certain problems.

## Advantages

1. **Exponential Speed-Up**  
   - Classically, factoring an $n$-bit integer grows super-polynomially. Shor's Algorithm can factor an $n$-bit integer in roughly $O(n^3) $ steps (or better with optimizations), showcasing a significant theoretical advantage.

2. **Demonstration of Quantum Superiority**  
   - Alongside [[Grover’s Algorithm]] for unstructured search, Shor’s Algorithm remains a cornerstone example of how quantum computers can outperform classical systems for specific tasks.

3. **Driving Innovation in Cryptography**  
   - The cryptographic world now intensively researches **lattice-based**, **code-based**, or other **post-quantum** cryptosystems to stay ahead of the quantum threat.

## Challenges

1. **Quantum Hardware Requirements**  
   - To factor large numbers (e.g., 2048-bit RSA moduli), you need **thousands to millions** of *logical* qubits with fault tolerance and low error rates—well beyond current quantum hardware capabilities.

2. **Error Correction**  
   - Real quantum systems suffer from *noise* and *decoherence*, necessitating robust quantum error correction schemes (e.g., the **surface code**). These in turn require many *physical* qubits to create a single *logical* qubit.

3. **Implementation Complexity**  
   - Designing, programming, and stabilizing a large-scale quantum circuit for Shor’s Algorithm is complex. Even with today’s quantum libraries, only small numbers (tens to hundreds of bits) can be factored reliably.

## Applying Shor’s Algorithm to Cryptography

### Challenges in Classical Cryptography

Modern cryptosystems like [[RSA]], [[Diffie–Hellman]] **Key Exchange**, and[[Elliptic Curves]] Cryptography rely on the hardness of factoring large integers or computing discrete logarithms. A classical computer cannot feasibly solve these problems for properly chosen key sizes (e.g., 2048-bit or higher). However, with Shor’s Algorithm:

- **Factoring RSA Moduli**: Breaking RSA requires factoring a large semi-prime $N = p \times q$. Shor’s Algorithm can do this in polynomial time, undermining RSA’s security assumptions.
- **Discrete Log Problems**: Similar logic applies to discrete log variants (e.g., [[Diffie–Hellman]] and ECC), making them vulnerable to quantum attacks.

### How Shor’s Algorithm Works (High-Level)

1. **Choose a Random $a$**  
   - Select an integer $a$ coprime to $N$ (the integer to be factored).
2. **Quantum Period-Finding**  
   - Construct and evaluate the function $f(x) = a^x $mod N$ within a *quantum* circuit.  
   - Use the **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** to find the *period* $r$ of this function in *superposition*.
3. **Classical GCD**  
   - Once the period $r$ is found, compute $\gcd(a^{r/2} \pm 1, N)$ to discover non-trivial factors of $N$.

## Example: Factoring a Small Number with Shor's Algorithm

Below is a simplified Python-style pseudo-code using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). This example can factor very small numbers (like 15, 21), illustrating core concepts rather than large-scale factorization. More info [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/blob/main/notebooks/ch-algorithms/shor.ipynb)

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister, Aer, execute
from qiskit.circuit.library import QFT

def shor_factor(N):
    """
    Pseudo-code function to demonstrate the structure
    of a Shor's Algorithm circuit for a small integer N.
    For large N, a significantly more complex circuit and
    quantum resources are required.
    """

    # 1. Choose a random 'a' coprime to N
    a = find_random_coprime(N)  # Placeholder function

    # 2. Determine number of qubits needed for the range [0 .. 2^m-1] ~ N^2
    m = 4  # For demonstration, a small circuit

    # Quantum registers: 'x' for superposition, 'f' to store a^x mod N
    x = QuantumRegister(m, name='x')
    f = QuantumRegister(m, name='f')
    c = ClassicalRegister(m, name='c')
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(x, f, c)

    # 3. Initialize x register to superposition (Hadamard transforms)
    for qubit in x:
        circuit.h(qubit)

    # 4. Implement the modular exponentiation a^x mod N on the 'f' register
    #    (Pseudo-code: in reality, this is done via repeated modular multiplications)
    circuit = apply_mod_exp(circuit, x, f, a, N)

    # 5. Apply Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to the x register
    qft_dagger = QFT(num_qubits=m, do_swaps=False).inverse()
    circuit.append(qft_dagger.to_instruction(), x[:])

    # 6. Measure x register
    circuit.measure(x, c)

    # 7. Run on a simulator
    simulator = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
    result = execute(circuit, simulator, shots=1024).result()
    counts = result.get_counts()

    # Try GCD steps with a^(r/2) ± 1 to find non-trivial factors of N
